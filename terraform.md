# Infrastructure As Code-IAC
- Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files CODE.
- Infrastructure as Code (or IaC) is an automated type of infrastructure management. The model approaches networks, virtual machines, storage etc in a descriptive manner via versioning (similar to DevOps tracking source code).
- Like Developers write Application Code to build Applications, Technologies - Java, Python, Node etc
- As a DevOps Engineer will be writing Infrastructure Code to build Infrastructure - AWS Cloudformation, Azure ARM, Terraform etc
- IaC boosts productivity through automation
- Consistency in Setup & Configuration by Minimising risk of human errors
- Replicate your infrastructure easily, CODE = REUSABILITY
- Makes your infrastructure Auditable, Since you can version control IaC configuration files like any source code file, you have full traceability of the changes
